# What did I do?

Since the focus of the challenge wasn't the design, I decide to use MaterialUI components to achieve a good UI out of the box.

To store the children I decided to use redux, even though it's overkill for a small like these, I wanted it to feel like a real-world and bigger application.
I also used the store for managing a couple of UI states.

To handle asynchronous actions (effects), I decided to use redux-observable instead of thunk. I actually find it more clean and powerful (but of course I don't mind working with thunk).

For the check-in/out actions, since we are loading a lot of data all at once, initially I didn't want to trigger a refresh of the whole list, since it's a lot of data. So after doing the POST request I wanted to update manually in store only the single child.
Unfortunately typescript was giving me some bad errors about the updateChild action, I could resolve them, but I'm out of time for the challenge, so I just trigger a reload of the all children after the check-in/out request for now.

# Interested in working for Famly?

Give us a chance to see your beautiful code! ü§©

How to get started:

- Fork this repository
- Create a small application in React (or another agreed upon framework)
- Describe your design decisions and setup instructions in the README.md of the forked repository

The application should be able to do 3 things:

1. List children with some form of pagination/lazy-loading/infinite-scroll
2. Checkin a child
3. Checkout a child

There are no other requirements than that‚Äîdon't worry about design or anything like that.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to ckl@famly.co (Christian) or ab@famly.co (Adam) ‚ò∫Ô∏è
